## Day 1 : THIS IS THE FIRST SUB
SUBMITTING TO GITHUB 

Task: Implement a basic hash table without collision resolution.

1. Implement a `HashTable` class and `HashTableEntry` class.

2. Implement a good hashing function.

   Recommend either of:

   * DJB2
   * FNV-1 (64-bit)

   You are allowed to Google for these hashing functions and implement
   from psuedocode.

3. Implement the `hash_index()` that returns an index value for a key.

4. Implement the `put()`, `get()`, and `delete()` methods.

You can test this with:

```
python test_hashtable_no_collisions.py
```

The above test program is _unlikely_ to have collisions, but it's
certainly possible for various hashing functions. With DJB2 (32 bit) and
FNV-1 (64 bit) hashing functions, there are no collisions.
